# arcade-gui 

GUI interface and widgets. Documentation is found throughout the files, though in some areas it may be obsolete or incomplete.

More than meets the eye in the examples. To see all features, look at the source code of each widget. This includes several different types of interactive widgets and various shapes. It also includes API for creating your own widgets, which are quite easy to do. Everything is object-oriented, which aids in accessing properties and setting them. These built-in widgets have plenty of documentation and functions.

Several widgets are provided to use. These include `Image`, `Label`, `Button`, `Slider`, `Toggle`, `Entry`, `Combobox`, and various shapes. Like most projects based off Pyglet, in this GUI toolkit, all widgets subclass a base widget class, which dispatches events to them.

This uses the Pyglet and Arcade libraries, which are still active and working today. Arcade's website is https://arcade.academy/, while Pyglet's is https://pyglet.org/.

Contributions are welcome.
